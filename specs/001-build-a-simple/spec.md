# Feature Specification: Financial News Aggregator

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-simple`  
**Created**: 2025-09-11  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a simple web app that aggregates recent headlines from leading financial and business news sources including Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, CNBC, DealStreetAsia, The Business Times (Singapore), The Edge (Malaysia), and South China Morning Post (SCMP). The app should fetch headlines from RSS feeds or by scraping, refresh data regularly, and display 5‚Äì10 of the latest stories per publication. The interface should present a clean, responsive layout with separate sections for each source, showing the headline, publication date/time, and a clickable link that opens the full article on the publisher's website."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user seeking financial news, I want to view recent headlines from multiple trusted business sources in one consolidated view so I can quickly catch up on important business and financial developments without having to visit each publication's website separately.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am on the news aggregator homepage, **When** I load the page, **Then** I should see headlines from all 8 specified financial news sources displayed in separate sections
2. **Given** I am viewing the news feed, **When** I click on a headline link, **Then** I should be directed to the full article on the publisher's website in a new tab
3. **Given** the news feed is loading, **When** data refresh occurs, **Then** I should see the 5-10 most recent stories from each publication with accurate publication dates/times
4. **Given** I am using the application on different devices, **When** I access the interface, **Then** the layout should adapt to screen size and remain fully usable

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a news source is temporarily unavailable or returns no data?
- How does the system handle publications that change their website structure, breaking article links?
- What happens when there are more or fewer than 5-10 available stories from a source?
